Python has a number of built-in functions to read and write information from a file on your computer.
The "open" function is used to open a file. The file can be opened in a read mode(using "r" as a second argument) or
in a write mode(using "w" as a second argument). The "open" function returns the file object. You need to store it to close the file later.

Print the "input.txt" content to the output. Print the first line of "input1.txt". Close file.
