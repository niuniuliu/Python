Boolean operators compare statements and return results in boolean values.
The boolean operator "and" returns True when the expressions on both sides of "and" are true.
The boolean operator "or" returns True when at least one expression on either side of "or" is true.
The boolean operator "not" placed before a boolean expression inverts it.
