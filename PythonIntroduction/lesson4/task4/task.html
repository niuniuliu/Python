Tuples are almost identical to lists. The only significant difference between tuples and lists is that tuples cannot be changed.
That is to say you cannot add, change, or delete elements from the tuple.
Tuples are constructed by a comma operator with enclosing parentheses (a, b, c).
A single item tuple must have a trailing comma, such as (d,).
