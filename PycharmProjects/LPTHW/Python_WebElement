Help on WebElement in module selenium.webdriver.remote.webelement object:

class WebElement(__builtin__.object)
 |  Represents a DOM element.
 |  
 |  Generally, all interesting operations to do with interacting with a
 |  document will be performed through this interface.
 |  
 |  All method calls will do a freshness check to ensure that the element
 |  reference is still valid.  This essentially determines whether or not the
 |  element is still attached to the DOM.  If this test fails, then an
 |  `StaleElementReferenceException` is thrown, and all future calls to this
 |  instance will fail.
